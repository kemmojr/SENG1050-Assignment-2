			A Newcastle entrepreneur Donald Drumpf plans to begin a business providing services to customers in their own homes. Called <em>Service U</em>, customers can register online and book services such as interior decorating, landscape and garden planning, physical training, life coaching, remedial massage, financial advice or babysitting. Each of these services is provided by an independent business who deliver their services in the customer’s own home. All the businesses are self-owned and they will pay Donald a fee to appear on the web site called <em>Service U</em>.</p>

<p> With this in mind, Donald Drumpf has invited you, as a promising student of the University of Newcastle with web communication skills, to develop a web site, <em>Service U</em>. Donald would like you to construct a prototype of the web page to be launched. He would like you to choose TWO of the services listed above and, for each, provide a page listing THREE businesses offering that service. That means that, if you choose baby sitting as a service, your page should list THREE baby sitting services. <br><br>

			Your task is to present the businesses as appealingly as possible on the web. 
		</p>
		
        <p>
          Your assignment will have the following parts.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><a href="#home">A Homepage</a></li>
          <li><a href="#form">A "Data Collection" page</a></li>
	    <li><a href="#peb">2 Services pages</a> with descriptions of THREE businesses offering the service.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          All pages must have good readability, consistency and navigation. Details of all of these pages are given below.
        </p>

        <hr />

		<h2 id="all"> General guidelines for preparing your all web pages </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>All pages should be coded according to the HTML5 standard.</li>
			<li>All pages should contain the full HTML5 document structure, including &lt;&#33;DOCTYPE&gt;, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt; and &lt;body&gt;</li>
			<li>All pages should use Cascading Style Sheets for visual formatting. You must use an external style file (style.css) 
				which will define the style for all web pages you have created, 
				Embedded (Document-level) style (where appropriate) and a few (NOT many) inline styles.
				<ul>
				    <li>All visual formatting of the Web site should be implemented using
						<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">Cascading Style Sheets</a>.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Use one external CSS for all web pages.</strong></li>
					<li>Use at least one <em>id</em> and  one <em>class</em> selector.</li>
					<li>At least one &lt;div&gt;, used to provide some interesting styling (your choice of borders, background, floating alignment, etc.)</li>
					<li>At least one &lt;span&gt;, used to provide some formatting (e.g. a colour or font change) for a few words of text</li>
					<li>You should use a document-level style sheet to apply styles that
						are unique to the particular page (if appropriate).
					</li>
					<li>You should only use inline styles for one-off visual effects.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
        
			<li>Your assignment directory should contain a sub-directory, named <em>images</em> with all the image files you are using in your web pages. </li>
			<li>There should be a nice background for the whole web site but make sure the text is still readable.</li>
			<li>There should be a left side margin of 1 cm for all pages.</li>
			<li>There should be hyperlinks on each of the pages that provide navigation capabilities for your site. </li>
				<ul>
					<li>Hyperlinks from the Index page to other pages. Also hyperlinks from other pages back to the Index page. These links should use <em>a relative</em> URL.</li>
					<li>Each page should also have links to every other page. </li>
					<li>The text colours of a link before they are visited, after they are visited and during a user action must be different from each other. The link must appear noticibly bigger when you move the cursor over them.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>The pages must have good readability, consistency and navigation.</li>
			<li>Comments for your HTML code: Comments at the top of the file, stating the name of the file, 
			the name of the author and the date the file was created. 
			</li>
		</ul>


		<hr />

        <h2 id="home">Homepage</h2>

        <p>
          Your submission should contain a homepage, called
          <b>index.html</b> which you created in Assignment 1. 
		  You may need to make changes to this page, to ensure that any links to other pages in the website work,
		  or incorporate any other updates listed in your assignment 1 feedback. 
        </p>
<p>
Links necessary for Homepage are
<ul>
<li>A link to the data collection page (form).</li>
<li>A privacy policy. This is necessary as you are collecting data including personal identifying information (PII) from your guests. When creating this, you may use a template such as that at <a href="https://www.visser.com.au/blog/generic-privacy-policy-for-australian-websites/">https://www.visser.com.au/blog/generic-privacy-policy-for-australian-websites/</a></li>
<li>Terms and conditions. Use template at <a href="https://media.termsfeed.com/pdf/terms-and-conditions-template.pdf">https://media.termsfeed.com/pdf/terms-and-conditions-template.pdf</a></li>
<li>About us. Use template at <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/best-about-us-pages">https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/best-about-us-pages</a></li>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="form">Data Collection Page</h2>

        <p>
            This page will allow businesses to apply for inclusion in the web portal <em>Service U</em>. The form will collect business data as well as some personal information (so there should 
			be a link to the privacy policy on this page as well). This upload will be done as a form, which sends the information to 
"http://www.cs.tut.fi/cgi-bin/run~jkorpela/echo.cgi"
when applicants click the "Submit" button. The following things need to be 
			included on the page.
        </p>
		<h3> Create the form</h2>
		<p> The form needs to have at least the following things.
        <ol>
          <li>An appropriate level 1 heading.</li>
		  <li>Mandatory information about the business;
			<ul>
			    <li>A full name of owner/manager,</li>
				<li>Email</li>
				<li>Age range (less than 20, 20-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, more than 60),</li>
				<li>Address,</li>
				<li>more ...</li>
			</ul></li>		  
          <li>Survey questions decided by you. Think through what you need to know about the business (qualifications, experience, ...).
			<ul>
				<li>Use different types of input such as textboxes, dropdown menus, radio buttons, checkboxes and textareas 
		      (at least 1 of each).</li>
			</ul></li>
          <li>Buttons to submit and clear the form.</li>          
        </ol>

		<h3> Validate the form</h3>
		<p>You will write <strong>Javascript functions</strong> to validate the form 
		   (<i>DO NOT USE HTML5 form validation attributes such as 'required'</i>).  </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Use JavaScript to perform client-side data validation.</li>
			<li>The validation functions should check that at least three required inputs (marked with asterisks)
			in your form are filled out. </li>
			<li>These should be different types of input (e.g., textbox, dropdown menus, 
				radio buttons or checkboxes), 
				so the validation will be done differently for each one.</li>
			<li>The validation functions should check a valid email address 
			    (<i>please do not use HTML5 form validation INPUT types such as INPUT type="email"</i>).</li>
			<li>If the form does not pass the validation check, the user should be presented with an alert message
				asking them to provide the missing information or correct the wrong information.</li>	
		
		</ol>
		
		<p> The validation functions should be initiated when the form is submitted. </p>
		
        <p> 
           The structure and presentation of this page is up to you 
           however the specifications provided here must be followed.
        </p>


        <hr />



 	  <h2 id="peb">Business Information Display Pages</h2>

        <p>
          You will be writing an XSL document to transform your XML documents from Assignment 1 
          into HTML. The HTML that is generated should fit in with the style of the rest of your website (<i>eg.,
          similar formatting, colors, etc.</i>). You will need to use CSS in your generated HTML.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note</b> that all your XML documents have the same tags and DTD and therefore they can all
          use the same XSL document. This means you should only make 1 XSL file. 
		  The XSL should have the following;
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>An appropriate level 1 heading indicating the service. </li>
          <li>List of all the businesses sorted alphabetically by the business name</li>
		  <li>Include the following.
            <ul>
              <li>Busiiness details.</li> 
              <li>An image associated with the business</li>
		   <li>URL of the business</li>			 
			</ul> 
		  </li> 		  
          <li>All this data must be collected from the XML documents.</li>
          <li>Other relevant information that is in your XML documents.</li>
    </ul>

		<hr />
		<h2 id="design">Web Design</h2>
		<p>
		A successful website meets clearly identified goals and provides compelling content that draws 
		your audience to your site again and again. In addition it should be easy to navigate and 
		feature visual attractiveness.
		</P>
	

		<hr />
		<h2 id="style" >Coding Style</h2>
		<p>
			Please note that your HTML code, CSS code and XSL code must be neat, clear, and commented. A clean structure 
			is important for a site that will be maintained and updated later by someone else, who won't have 
			your memory of how things are structured.
		</P>
		<p>Other than the specifications mentioned, the way you design your page is up to you. However it should use semantically-correct tags. 
		All your work should be validated. 
		</P>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="submit">Submission</h2>

        <p>
          Your submission should contain all the files that contribute to
          the Web site, including HTML, CSS, XML, XSL and image files. 
          You must also include a <span class="file">README.txt</span> file,
          containing your student number and a list of the files that are part
          of your submission.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, your submission should include a completed
          Assignment Cover Sheet. You should download a
          cover sheet template,
          then fill in the details and include it with your submission.
          <em>Note:</em> an Assignment Cover Sheet submitted electronically is deemed to
          have been signed.
          Your assignment <strong>cannot</strong> be marked until a completed cover sheet
          is received.
	  </p><p>Failure to follow submission instructions will incur a penalty.

          <h3 id="plagiarism">Warning - Plagiarism</h3>

          <p>
            Plagiarism is defined as
            <dfn>presenting the work of others' as if it were your own</dfn>.
            This includes the copying of content from other people's
            Web pages (and other sources) without "appropriate referencing"
            (indicating the parts of your assignment which have been
            copied and where they were copied from).
          </p>

          <p>
            If you "quote" or use other people's work in your assignments, then
            you <strong>must</strong> reference them appropriately. If you fail to do 
            so you will be reported to the School's Student Academic Conduct Officer (SACO) 
            for suspicion of plagiarism. An assignment that consists largely of work copied 
            from elsewhere and referenced appropriately will receive very low (zero) marks.  
          </p>
